      <h1>Why are you making comics?</h1>
      <p>I create because that's what humans do. I've been telling my nephews, nieces, and anyone that would listen to do what they love and don't worry about getting a job.</p>
      <p>I created a curricullum called The Elementary MBA (tm) and taught it to children for four years because I believe in it so much. Last month I got an offer to sell the trademark The Elementary MBA.</p>
      <p>I made higher archy of needs for the curricullum. Showed it to my uncle. He told me that I need to be successful with it before anyone will believe it works.</p>
      <p>So I'm doing it. Just to prove I'm right.</p>
